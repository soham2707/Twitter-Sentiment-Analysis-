# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-
This a project of twitter sentiment analysis using machine learning(Support Vector Machines,Naive Bayes), deep learning(LSTM), Transformer(BERT,ROBERTA).

We know that Twitter is a social media platform. Here everyone can create an account and portrayed their own views. Apparently, we can see that the power of portraying independent views in social media is immeasurable but there are some bad sides too. In some cases, people are conveying their opinion with less research and not knowing the fact on social media. As a consequence people are getting confused about the fact, which information is real and which information is fake.


Goal:
-----

Our goal is to check the sentiment of a tweet over a topic. It can massively be used to check the sentiment of a new product. There are 3 results over the sentiment analysis. The sentiment can be positive, negative, neutral. Based on that result we can analyse the transparency of the new product.


DATASET:
----
The dataset is based on the tweet of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. By using this dataset we will identify the sentiment of common people. Here the number of the tweet is 1,62,981.

"Twitter US Airline Sentiment" Analyze how travelers in February 2015 expressed their feelings on Twitter. Here the number of the tweet is 14,000.

Approach:
----
**_Here there are 3 type of approach._**

├──  **Machine Learning** |-- **SVM , Naive Bayes**

├── **Deep Learning** |-- **LSTM**

├── **Transformer** |-- **BERT ROBERTA**
